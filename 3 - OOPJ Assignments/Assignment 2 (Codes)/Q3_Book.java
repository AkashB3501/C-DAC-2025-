Problem 3: Library Book Tracker
Scenario: A library in Delhi wants to track how many books are issued in total and details of each book.
Requirements:
1. Create a Book class with instance variables: title (String), author (String), issued (boolean).
2. Create static variable totalIssuedBooks to keep track of the total number of books issued.
3. Create a constructor to initialize the book details.
4. Create getters and setters for all instance variables.
5. Create a static method showTotalIssued() to print total issued books.
6. Write a main class to create 3 books, issue some of them (issued = true), and show total issued
books.
Input Example:
Book1: "Harry Potter", Author: "J.K. Rowling", Issued: true
Book2: "Five Point Someone", Author: "Chetan Bhagat", Issued: false
Book3: "Rich Dad Poor Dad", Author: "Robert Kiyosaki", Issued: true
Expected Output:
Book1 issued? true
Book2 issued? false
Book3 issued? true
Total books issued: 2
